# Machine-Learning-Project
By Rundong Chen & Darren Tam- Group 28

# Proposal
The purpose of this project was to analyze a dataset of twitter reviews about 6 US airlines, namely: Virgin America, Delta, Southwest, United, American, and US Airways, in order to determine whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. 

This will allow airlines to determine how their customers review their services without having to read through the comments and figuring out whether it's a postive or negative comment. This may also be used to compare the satisfactory rate of the airlines by isolating the comments for each airline. The program uses sentiment analysis to determine the subjectivity of the comments and returns an accuracy of 75-80%.
